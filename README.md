# Keybinds
All the default I3 keybinds + 
| Keybind       | Action        
| ------------- |:-------------:
| Mod+Shift+z   | Opens Sidebar     
| Mod+Shift+r   | Reloads Config
| Ctrl+Space    | Clears the newest notification
| Ctrl+Shift+Space   | Clears all notifications

# Known Issues 
I will fix these when I have timeâ€¦
* When opening the sidebar quickly, the Spotify widget will bug out, resulting in you not being able to close the sidebar. This can be solved by reloading the config but is very annoying. This seems to only happen on Ubuntu.
